INTRODUCTION                                    *weefactor*

Weefactor is a collection of small Ruby refactorings.

REFACTORINGS                                    *weefactor-refactorings*

The following commands do as you'd expect. Your cursor must be on the
line in question for the refactoring to work.

:ExtractRspecLet
:ConvertStructToClass

MAPPINGS                                        *weefactor-mappings*

You may also want quicker access to the refactorings. For that you can add
mappings to your vimrc. For example:
>
map <leader>l <Plug>ExtractRspecLet
map <leader>s <Plug>ConvertStructToClass
>
Each <Plug> mapping corresponds with the command it maps.
